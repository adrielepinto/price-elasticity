# Business Problem 
The company Prodcts & Cia intends to change the prices of the products sold, but also is afraid that this change will impact the demand for these products and, consequently, the billing. This demand has been submitted to you and as a data scientist me need to determine price elasticity using scientific methodology based on price data for the products sold by the company.
